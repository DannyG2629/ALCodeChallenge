# ALCodeChallenge
This repository contains an application which will query the Stack Overflow API and allow users to select from a list of recent questions with multiple answers and one accepted answer. Users will then guess the accepted answer from a randomly sorted list of answers and be notified if the selected answer was the accepted answer or not.
